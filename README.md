GPA Target Score Calculator
A web-based academic calculator designed to help university students determine the marks required in their Semester End Examination (SEE) to achieve specific grade point targets (A+, A, B+) in each subject.

This tool is tailored to handle complex evaluation schemes, with different weightages for theory and theory-lab combined subjects. It provides a clear, user-friendly interface for students to input their internal assessment marks and instantly see the exam scores they need to aim for.

Features
Dynamic Course Loading: Automatically populates subjects and credits based on the selected branch and semester.

Custom Weightage Logic: Implements precise calculation logic for different course types:

Theory Subjects: 60% CE (Internals) + 40% SEE.

Theory + Lab Subjects: 30% CE + 30% LPW (Lab) + 40% SEE.

Smart UI: Input fields for lab work (LPW) are automatically disabled for theory-only subjects to prevent incorrect data entry.

Instant Target Calculation: Click the "Generate SEE Marks" button to calculate the required exam scores for achieving 10 (A+), 9 (A), and 8 (B+) grade points.

Clear Results: The calculator indicates if a target grade is "Not Possible" (N/P) even with a perfect SEE score.

Responsive Design: A clean, modern interface that is easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
